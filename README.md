# calibration-service

## Overview

This backend service is designed to manage calibrations of a hardware device. Each calibration includes:

- `calibration_type`
- `value`
- `timestamp`
- `username`

Calibrations can be tagged with arbitrary strings to describe different states of a device. Tags can be added or removed
from calibrations, and the tagging history is preserved.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   uv run db_init
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uv run dev
   ```

## Database Management

The service uses PostgreSQL for data storage and Alembic for database migrations. Key commands:

```bash
# Initialize database and run migrations
uv run db_init

# Apply pending migrations
uv run db_migrate

# Create a new migration
uv run db_create "Description of changes"
```

For detailed information about database operations and migrations, see:
