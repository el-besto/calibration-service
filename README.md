# calibration-service

## Overview

This backend service is designed to manage calibrations of a hardware device. Each calibration includes:

- `calibration_type`
- `value`
- `timestamp`
- `username`

Calibrations can be tagged with arbitrary strings to describe different states of a device. Tags can be added or removed
from calibrations, and the tagging history is preserved.
